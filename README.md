## Project Description
This project is a contact management application built using Express and Node.js. It allows users to add, update, delete, and view contacts stored in a JSON file. This application demonstrates the use of Express routing, middleware, and basic CRUD operations in a Node.js environment.

## Development Environment
- **Operating System**: npm
- **Node.js Version**: Node.js v20.11.0
- **Editors Used**: Visual Studio Code
- Additional Tools and Libraries:
  - Express.js for the server framework
  - git-scm for push projects to GitHub repository 

## Installation/Running Instructions
1. Clone the repository from GitHub:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/cshu3/ITMD542/tree/master/express-contacts.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd express-contacts
   ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the application:

   Alternatively, if you have Nodemon installed, you can use `npm run dev` to start the server with automatic restarts.
5. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000/contacts`.

## Insights and Results
Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable experience with Express and Node.js, including routing, middleware usage, and the EJS templating engine. I faced challenges in managing asynchronous operations and error handling, which led to a deeper understanding of JavaScript's async/await patterns.
